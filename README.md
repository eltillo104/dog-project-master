# Artificial Intelligence
In the last few years we've seen something truly remarkable. Artificial Intelligence is trying to emulate the learning process of biological brains for machines to learn as we do. This is my contribution to this amazing world that keeps amazing me everyday. As an Electrical Design and Controls Engineer I deal with programming automatic machines in different industries. I wanted to go beyond programming machines that only seem smart but to actually BE smart and learn from their own mistakes. My motivation are robots that can improve themselves in the future to help humanity advance further, get rid of everyday tasks and will lastly result in a better quality of life for everyone. As humans we don't like jobs that have the same routine everyday, we are creators in nature and will be great to have this intelligent machines. This is my first attempt to understand the wonderful world of Artificial Intelligence. Feel free to contact me if you have a similar mission in life and we can share ideas.
