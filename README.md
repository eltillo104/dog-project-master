# Artificial Intelligence: Deep Learning
I encourage you to go over my projects and give me any suggestions.
### Predicting Bike Sharing Data

In this project, I built my first neural network and used it to predict daily bike rental ridership.

Imagine you own a Bike Sharing company and you want to know how many bikes you're going to need for potential customers.
I programmed a neural network to predict how many bikes we're going to need based from historical data.
### Dog Breed Classifier

In this project, I built a Convolutional Neural Network that processes user-supplied dog images and gives an estimate of the dog's breed.

Given an image of a dog, my algorithm identifies an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. 
If supplied an image of a human, the code identifies the resembling dog breed.
### TV Script Generation

In this project, I built a Recurrent Neural Network that generates a new episode dialogue for The Simpsons learning from other episode dialogues.

I used a Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons to generate a new Simpsons TV Script. 
The Neural Network I built generates a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern.
### Face Generation

In this project, I built a Generative Adversarial Network that Generates New Faces of Celebrities from a dataset of Celibrity Faces.

Created a program using Generative Adversarial Networks to Generate New Faces from Images of Celebrity Faces. The Generator tries to
fool the Discriminator and gets better at generating new celebrity images. The celebrity images generated are very impressive.
### Quadcopter Project

In this project, I built a Deep Reinforcement Learning program that teaches a Quadcopter how to fly, hover, and land using the Actor-Critic Method.

I created a Deep Reinforcement Learning Agent that takes off, stays at a certain height, and lands to the ground after. This is the most
complex project to understand from this repository. Please feel free to ask me how I can help you understand this program. I also welcome
you to give me some advice to improve this agent's learning.
