# Artificial Intelligence: Deep  Reinforcement Learning
I encourage you to go over my projects and give me any suggestions.

### Quadcopter Project

In this project, I built a Deep Reinforcement Learning program that teaches a Quadcopter how to fly, hover, and land using the Actor-Critic Method.

I created a Deep Reinforcement Learning Agent that takes off, stays at a certain height, and lands to the ground after. This is the most
complex project to understand from this repository. Please feel free to ask me how I can help you understand this program. I also welcome
you to give me some advice to improve this agent's learning.

### Navigation Project

In this project, I built a program in which an agent collects yellow bananas in a 3D environment. 

The goal of the game is to obtain as many yellow bananas in an episode as possible while avoiding blue bananas. Yellow bananas reward the agent with 1 point while blue bananas decrease the reward by 1 point. I made use of Deep Q learning for this task and achieved a total score of 13 points for 1 episode.
