# Artificial Intelligence: Deep Learning
The following are some projects that show the power of Deep Learning. 
I use a variety of Deep Learning algorithms, including:
- Neural Networks
- Convolutional Neural Networks
- Recurrent Neural Networks
- Generative Adversarial Networks
### Predicting Bike Sharing Data

In this project, I built my first neural network and used it to predict daily bike rental ridership.

Imagine you own a Bike Sharing company and you want to know how many bikes you're going to need for potential customers.
I programmed a neural network to predict how many bikes we're going to need making use of our historical data.
### Dog Breed Classifier

In this project, I built a Convolutional Neural Network that processes user-supplied dog images and gives an estimate of the dog's breed.

Given an image of a dog, my algorithm identifies an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. 
If supplied an image of a human, the code identifies the resembling dog breed.
### TV Script Generation

In this project, I built a Recurrent Neural Network that generates a new episode dialogue for The Simpsons learning from other episode dialogues.

I used a Simpsons dataset of scripts from 27 seasons to generate a new Simpsons TV Script. 
The Neural Network I built generates a new TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern.
### Face Generation

In this project, I built a Generative Adversarial Network that Generates New Faces of Celebrities from a dataset of Celibrity Faces.

Created a program using Generative Adversarial Networks to Generate New Faces from Images of Celebrity Faces. The Generator tries to
fool the Discriminator and gets better at generating new celebrity images. The celebrity images generated are very impressive.
